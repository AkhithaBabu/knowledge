# Lesson 14 - Super Resolution; Image Segmentation with U-Net

_These are my personal notes from fast.ai course and will continue to be updated and improved if I find anything useful and relevant while I continue to review the course to study much more in-depth. Thanks for reading and happy learning!_

## Topics

* Super resolution.
  * A technique that allows us to restore high resolution detail in our images, based on a convolutional neural network.
  * In the process, weâ€™ll look at a few modern techniques for faster and more reliable training of generative convnets.
* Image segmentation.
  * U-Net architecture.
    * A state of the art technique that has won many Kaggle competitions and is widely used in industry.
  * Image segmentation models allow us to precisely classify every part of an image, right down to pixel level.
