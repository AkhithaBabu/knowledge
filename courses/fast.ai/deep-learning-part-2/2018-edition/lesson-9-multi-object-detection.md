# Lesson 9 - Multi-object Detection

_These are my personal notes from fast.ai course and will continue to be updated and improved if I find anything useful and relevant while I continue to review the course to study much more in-depth. Thanks for reading and happy learning!_

## Topics

* Move from single object to multi-object detection.
* **Main focus** is on the single shot multibox detector \(SSD\).
  * Multi-object detection by using a loss function that can combine losses from multiple objects, across both localization and classification.
  * Custom architecture that takes advantage of the difference receptive fields of different layers of a CNN.
* YOLO v3
* Simple but powerful trick called focal loss.
