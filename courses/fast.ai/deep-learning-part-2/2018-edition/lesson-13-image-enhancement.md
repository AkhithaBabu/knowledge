# Lesson 13 - Image Enhancement; Style Transfer; Data Ethics

_These are my personal notes from fast.ai course and will continue to be updated and improved if I find anything useful and relevant while I continue to review the course to study much more in-depth. Thanks for reading and happy learning!_

## Topics

* Image enhancement.
  * Style transfer.
    * An interesting approach that allows us to change the style of images in whatever way we like.
    * Optimize pixels, instead of weights, which is an interesting different way of looking at optimization.
* Generative models (and many other techniques weâ€™ve discussed) can cause harm just as easily as they can benefit society.
  * Ethics in AI.
    * Bias is an important current topic in data ethics.
  * Get a taste of some of the key issues, and ideas for where to learn more.
* fastai library
  * TrainPhase API
    * SGD, SGD with Warm Restarts (SGDR), 1cycle
    * Discriminative learning rates + 1cycle
  * DAWNBench entries
    * ImageNet training
    * CIFAR10 result
