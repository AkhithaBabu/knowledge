# Lesson 7 - ResNets, U-Nets, GANs and RNNs

_These are my personal notes from fast.ai Live (the new International Fellowship programme) course and will continue to be updated and improved if I find anything useful and relevant while I continue to review the course to study much more in-depth. Thanks for reading and happy learning!_
