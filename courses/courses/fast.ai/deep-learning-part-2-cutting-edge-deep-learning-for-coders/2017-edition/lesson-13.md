### Project \[TODO\]

* \[time: 00:09:26\] Hats off again to Brad for drawing my attention to this paper, which is a new style transfer paper which can transfer to any style in real time. So you don't have to build a separate network for each one. This is the kind of thing which you could absolutely turn into an app. Obviously no one's done it yet because this paper's just come out. So you could be the first one to say here's an app which create any photo into any style you like.
